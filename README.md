# EpicSkillsGetterIMG
This script obtains all the images corresponding to character abilities from the Epic 7 Seven mobile game with certain exceptions. Obtains character names from a CSV file to search for the required images.
The CSV file was created using another script from another user. I will leave the link to your repository below: https://github.com/PThanapon/e7herodata/blob/main/e7HeroData.csv . All credits corresponding to its author.

The HTTP requests made in the script are made to the website https://epic7x.com/ which functions as a public database for Epic 7 Seven.

The script can be improved and I am still working on it to perfect it.

The script is only responsible for collecting public information and all rights associated with it correspond to its legitimate owners.
